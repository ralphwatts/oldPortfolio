<div id="attachment_33" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/9069862_xl.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/07/9069862_xl-300x170.jpg" alt="Annapolis eyeglass lenses" width="300" height="170" srcset="http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/9069862_xl-300x170.jpg 300w, http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/9069862_xl-1024x579.jpg 1024w, http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/9069862_xl-624x353.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Annapolis eyeglass lenses</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are in need of a comprehensive eye exam, or a new prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses, you will want to visit EyeFit Vision Centers. There are 11 locations to choose from, and we offer fine optometric service at each of our locations. If you are in need of <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis eyeglass lenses</a>, we offer not only eye exams by highly-qualified doctors, but also each location offers a wide selection of eyeglass frames to fit every budget and fashion need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that you have a comprehensive eye exam on a regularly-scheduled basis. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, have no obvious symptoms during their early stages. However if not detected early, eye diseases may cause irreversible vision loss. During a comprehensive eye exam, not only will we determine your visual acuity, but we will also screen you for many eye diseases and conditions that may be at the initial period of affecting your eyesight. The prescription you get at the conclusion of the exam will be the prescription that will work best for your new Annapolis eyeglass lenses. Not only will you be thrilled with your new eyeglass frames, should you choose to purchase a set, you will also be thrilled with your fresh, clearer vision that you will get to enjoy every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During a comprehensive eye exam, your eyes will be tested for diseases and conditions such as: glaucoma; diabetic retinopathy; macular degeneration; and cataracts. You may also have drops put in to dilate your eyes so that the back, retinal portion of your eye can be closely examined for any type of retinal problems. The corneal surface of your eye will also be examined for any types or corneal irregularities. If you need a contact lens prescription, you will have tests to measure the curvature of your cornea and the size of your iris. You may also be examined for dry eye. Once you have had your complete eye exam, you will be able to get new <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis eyeglass lenses</a>, or contact lenses, knowing that you now have the best up-to-date prescription to fit your vision needs. So whenever you think of eye exams or eyeglass and contact lens prescriptions, we hope your will think of EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
