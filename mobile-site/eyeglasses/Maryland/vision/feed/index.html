<p>Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, the number one <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a>, contact lenses are by far some of our most popular products. Contact lenses are so popular because they are so versatile and available in so many forms, so that they can cater to a wide range of patients’ needs and special interests. Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, we make sure that finding the contact lenses you need at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a> is as easy and convenient as it can be. The first step to getting contact lenses, whether it is your first time using them or you have used them for years, is to schedule a contact lens exam. Contact lens exams are crucial when it comes to making sure that your optical prescription for your lenses is accurate, as well as determining the proper measurements for your contact lenses so that they are fitted properly and they are comfortable for you to wear. Contact lens exams are similar to regular eye exams, they simply require a few extra steps related to your contact lenses and so may take a little while longer. It is important to come in to our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a> for a contact lens exam once a year so that we can check on your prescription and make changes as they are needed. If it is your first time using contact lenses, after your exam we will try different lenses with you and show you how to use them so that you end up with the perfect lenses for your needs, and so that you feel confident using them and taking care of them each day.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about our contact lens selection, or any of the other many eye care products and services available to you here at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a>, we highly recommend that you visit the main EyeFit Vision Centers website to browse through some additional, detailed information that you might find useful. If you have any specific questions or concerns that we can assist you with in any way, please do not hesitate to contact the staff here directly at your convenience.
