<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you wear sunglasses in the fall and winter months? If not, you should. Today doctors are talking about the importance of wearing sunscreen year round to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful rays. Many facial cosmetics even contain sunscreen to protect your face and lips throughout the year. It is just as important to wear sunglasses for UV protection for your eyes, even during the fall and winter month. If you want to get new <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">sunglasses in Annapolis</a>, you will be very excited to see our large selection at EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you come to our vision practice and optical boutique, our frame experts and opticians will be able to help you get the right kind of sunglasses that will provide UV protection. Our optometrist is Dr. Deborah Amoroso. There are different kinds of sunglasses lenses available, but not all provide this type of protection for the eyes. It is important to get sunglasses in Annapolis that block out 100% of the sun’s UVA and UVB rays in order for your eyes to be fully protected. Overexposure to these rays can cause many different eye problems down the road, including cataracts. When you are getting regular eyeglasses, there are also lens options that will eliminate UV exposure. Our optometrist, optician or frame expert will be able to give you additional information about these lens options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, you also want your <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">sunglasses in Annapolis</a> to be stylish and fashionable. For this reason we offer a wide selection of sunglasses for you to choose from. Our frame experts will be happy to help you find sunglasses that compliment your face shape and fashion sense. Sunglasses also have different colored lenses that may perform additional functions. Our knowledgeable experts will be happy to let you know more about the sunglasses you are thinking about purchasing, to make sure they are as functional as you would like for them to be. If you would like to get prescription sunglasses, you can make an appointment to see our optometrist for a new lens prescription. Patients enjoy the convenience of our one-stop-shopping optical center which allows them to get new eyeglass prescriptions, and then select great frames from the very same location. For an appointment with our optometrist contact us today. To only get a new eyeglass frame or pair of sunglasses, no appointment is ever necessary.</p>
