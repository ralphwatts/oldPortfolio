<p style="text-align: justify;">Comprehensive eye exams are essential in the diagnosis and treatment of your child’s vision problems, injuries, and diseases. Early detection allows for treatment to begin before the child experiences difficulty in school due to poor vision, or before any permanent damage has been done to the eye(s). At our <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, we strive to provide the highest quality of care so that your child can achieve optimal vision and eye health that does not affect their school work or other everyday activities. We focus on kid-friendly eye exams along with medical and surgical treatment for our littlest patients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eye examinations for children are especially important as five to ten percent of preschoolers and 25 percent of school-aged children have vision problems. The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that infants have their first eye exam at six months of age. Children should be re-examined at age three, and again just before they enter the first grade. Scheduling your child’s eye exam is crucial as many basic skills required in a child’s learning are associated with good eyesight, such as near and distance vision, binocular (two eyes) coordination, peripheral awareness, and hand-eye coordination. The AOA suggests that children who do not require vision correction should receive an eye exam every two years. Otherwise, children who do wear corrective lenses should have their vision evaluated annually. Comprehensive exams also test visual acuity, eye tracking and focusing skills, as well as detect problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, amblyopia, crossed eyes, dyslexia, and color blindness. Our team of caring Annapolis optometrists will also check for eye disease during your child’s eye exam, as well as assess how their eyes work together, and evaluate their eyes as an indicator of their overall health. Our office offers state of the art diagnostic equipment, including retinal photography and visual field testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, our mission is to preserve, restore, and enhance the vision of every member of your family. We are particularly inclined to treat those littler patients, as establishing good eye health early can deter further complications with their eyes and overall optical health. Please call our office today if you have any questions regarding pediatric eye exams, or if you would like to schedule an appointment.</p>
