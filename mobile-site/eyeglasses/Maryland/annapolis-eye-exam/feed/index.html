<p>People of all ages need to have eye exams. Whether we are talking about a young child, adult, or senior, it is important that comprehensive eye exams are performed on a regular basis. While every age group has its own eye care challenges, our optometrist will be able to help each individual receive the eye care that they need. If you want to see an optometrist who can provide you and family members with comprehensive eye exams, you will do well to visit us at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>, EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
<p>At our practice, you will be able to see an expert optometrist who will be able to give you a complete eye exam, or complete contact lens exam. If any diseases or disorders of the eye show up during the exam, our optometrist will either be able to treat the problem or refer you to an expert ophthalmologist for more involved medical care. Eye examinations are important at every age as there are serious eye problems that can develop at any point in your life. During a regular eye exam there will be a lot of testing done to uncover any possible eye problems. However, we want to assure you that you will be totally comfortable during the entire exam. There is no need for worry or concern when you get an eye exam at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>.</p>
<p>During a comprehensive eye exam many tests are performed. Your eyes will be checked to see if there are any refraction problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. Your eyes will be screened for a variety of problems including: glaucoma; cataracts; retinal problems; macular degeneration; or other problems of the eye. Regularly scheduled eye exams are so important because many eye problems do not have any obvious symptoms until vision has already been lost. For example, glaucoma has very few noticeable symptoms in the early stages. However, glaucoma can already be starting to gradually steal your sight. Once this disease is properly diagnosed it can be treated and most likely be kept at bay with continuous treatment. There is no need to lose any sight to this disease. However, if glaucoma is not diagnosed until a later stage, it is more difficult to treat. Also, any vision that has already been lost will not be able to be restored. Our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a> wants everyone to be able to keep their precious vision, and for that reason we encourage all to have regularly scheduled eye exams. If you would like to make an appointment to meet with one of our fine optometrists, contact us today at EyeFit Vision Centers to make an appointment.</p>
