<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are experiencing blurry vision, it is vital you visit your eye doctor to ensure your eyes are in good health, and that it is not an underlying symptom of a more serious condition. Although your blurry vision may be due to something as simple as general near- or far-sightedness, it could also be the early signs of glaucoma. A visit to your <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis eye doctor</a> at EyeFit Vision Centers for glaucoma screening and eye care will help determine and treat whatever the cause of your blurred vision may be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the United States, is an eye disease that can lead to a permanent loss of vision. Actually, glaucoma is not just one eye disease, but a group of eye conditions resulting in optic nerve damage, which causes loss of vision. Abnormally high pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure) usually, but not always, causes this damage. We provide all diagnostic and treatment options for glaucoma care, including glaucoma screening in. Glaucoma generally provides no warning signs or symptoms of disease, making testing an important part of a full vision exam. If it is determined that you do suffer from glaucoma, our Annapolis eye doctor will discuss which treatment plan is best for your individual needs. Glaucoma can be treated with eye drops, pills, laser surgery, traditional surgery, or a combination of these methods. The goal of any treatment is to prevent loss of vision, as vision loss from glaucoma is irreversible. Surgery can be an incredibly effective treatment option for your eye disease. Laser treatments, for example, can be utilized for precise treatment and quick healing. However, it is best to consult our doctors first to best decide on a treatment plan right for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Early diagnosis and treatment can minimize or prevent optic nerve damage and limit glaucoma-related vision loss. It&#8217;s important to get your eyes examined regularly, and make sure your eye doctor measures your intraocular pressure. So even if your vision is blurry, it is clear where you should go for your glaucoma testing and treatment; call EyeFit Vision Centers today to schedule an appointment with one of our <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis eye doctor</a>.</p>

<p>People of all ages need to have eye exams. Whether we are talking about a young child, adult, or senior, it is important that comprehensive eye exams are performed on a regular basis. While every age group has its own eye care challenges, our optometrist will be able to help each individual receive the eye care that they need. If you want to see an optometrist who can provide you and family members with comprehensive eye exams, you will do well to visit us at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>, EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
<p>At our practice, you will be able to see an expert optometrist who will be able to give you a complete eye exam, or complete contact lens exam. If any diseases or disorders of the eye show up during the exam, our optometrist will either be able to treat the problem or refer you to an expert ophthalmologist for more involved medical care. Eye examinations are important at every age as there are serious eye problems that can develop at any point in your life. During a regular eye exam there will be a lot of testing done to uncover any possible eye problems. However, we want to assure you that you will be totally comfortable during the entire exam. There is no need for worry or concern when you get an eye exam at our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>.</p>
<p>During a comprehensive eye exam many tests are performed. Your eyes will be checked to see if there are any refraction problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. Your eyes will be screened for a variety of problems including: glaucoma; cataracts; retinal problems; macular degeneration; or other problems of the eye. Regularly scheduled eye exams are so important because many eye problems do not have any obvious symptoms until vision has already been lost. For example, glaucoma has very few noticeable symptoms in the early stages. However, glaucoma can already be starting to gradually steal your sight. Once this disease is properly diagnosed it can be treated and most likely be kept at bay with continuous treatment. There is no need to lose any sight to this disease. However, if glaucoma is not diagnosed until a later stage, it is more difficult to treat. Also, any vision that has already been lost will not be able to be restored. Our <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a> wants everyone to be able to keep their precious vision, and for that reason we encourage all to have regularly scheduled eye exams. If you would like to make an appointment to meet with one of our fine optometrists, contact us today at EyeFit Vision Centers to make an appointment.</p>

<p>Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, our <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> are some of our most important services offered. They may seem simple, but that does not take away how crucial eye exams are to maintaining good eye health, and good health in general. Many people do not realize that your eyes are more than just the “windows to your soul,” as the saying goes, and that they too are the windows to the health of other areas of your body. Symptoms in your eyes and vision can be indicative of a wide range of health issues, including and excluding specifically eye and vision-related problems. In addition, it is important to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis due to the nature in which most eye problems develop: slowly. Many potentially serious eye conditions develop so gradually that it can be difficult to notice the subtle changes that occur in your vision or eye health as a result. The danger of this is that many people are unaware that they have a problem until the symptoms have built up and already done real damage. In order to avoid this, it is best to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis at a frequency recommended by the professionals here at EyeFit Vision Centers. When you choose to get your <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> with us, you can trust that you will get the fullest evaluation of your eye and vision health thanks to our expert eye care professionals, our state-of-the-art facility, and the reliable and informative testing methods that we use. We also offer a wide range of additional eye care services that we can recommend as they are needed.</p>
