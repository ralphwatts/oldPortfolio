In general, it is widely recommended the people of all ages see their eye doctor at least once a year, and eye health to keep your eye health as well as your general well-being in mind all the time. It helps to pay attention to any signs or symptoms as balls recent developments in order to determine when you should see any kind of physician or specialist, but it is just as helpful to see a variety of different healthcare providers are at the year in order to have comprehensive exams and testing completed regardless.

<p style="text-align: justify;">A child&#8217;s eyes are first examined upon exiting the birth canal for any initial sorts of deformities or developmental issues. These sorts of problems can be addressed at the hospital, but kids will continue to grow at a relatively rapid rate throughout their entire childhood. This is why it is widely recommended that children begin to see pediatric optometrist regularly from the time that they are about six months old. Because kids are still growing, it is important that you have a specialist exam in their eyes and the mechanics that control them in order to look out for any developmental issues, deformities, or any other signs of vision impairment. Vision impairments that involve eyesight disabilities, such as common ones like nearsightedness or farsightedness, or rather common and are easily treated with the use of prescription lenses, but there are a series of much more serious eye related conditions and disease that can also develop as well. These sorts of conditions can create lifelong effects, even irreversible side effects such as vision damage or loss. In order to prevent these things from happening, it is helpful to have your child see a pediatric optometrist at least once a year for a comprehensive exam. Our Annapolis optometrist here at EyeFit Vision Centers can help ensure that your child&#8217;s vision and overall eye health are in check.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eye exams, as well as a variety of other checkups and doctor visits, are especially important for children since they are still developing, but diseases and conditions can still occur in adults as well.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Comprehensive eye exams are essential in the diagnosis and treatment of your child’s vision problems, injuries, and diseases. Early detection allows for treatment to begin before the child experiences difficulty in school due to poor vision, or before any permanent damage has been done to the eye(s). At our <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, we strive to provide the highest quality of care so that your child can achieve optimal vision and eye health that does not affect their school work or other everyday activities. We focus on kid-friendly eye exams along with medical and surgical treatment for our littlest patients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eye examinations for children are especially important as five to ten percent of preschoolers and 25 percent of school-aged children have vision problems. The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that infants have their first eye exam at six months of age. Children should be re-examined at age three, and again just before they enter the first grade. Scheduling your child’s eye exam is crucial as many basic skills required in a child’s learning are associated with good eyesight, such as near and distance vision, binocular (two eyes) coordination, peripheral awareness, and hand-eye coordination. The AOA suggests that children who do not require vision correction should receive an eye exam every two years. Otherwise, children who do wear corrective lenses should have their vision evaluated annually. Comprehensive exams also test visual acuity, eye tracking and focusing skills, as well as detect problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, amblyopia, crossed eyes, dyslexia, and color blindness. Our team of caring Annapolis optometrists will also check for eye disease during your child’s eye exam, as well as assess how their eyes work together, and evaluate their eyes as an indicator of their overall health. Our office offers state of the art diagnostic equipment, including retinal photography and visual field testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, our mission is to preserve, restore, and enhance the vision of every member of your family. We are particularly inclined to treat those littler patients, as establishing good eye health early can deter further complications with their eyes and overall optical health. Please call our office today if you have any questions regarding pediatric eye exams, or if you would like to schedule an appointment.</p>

<p>All different kinds of people need to use vision correction in order to see clearly on a regular basis. Many kids end up developing some kind of vision impairment and it is important to make sure that your child has the proper eyewear especially before they go to school. Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, we can help you find the children’s eyeglasses that you are looking for. With <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis kid’s eyeglasses</a>, your children will be able to see comfortably and clearly no matter what.</p>
<div id="attachment_45" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9509022_xl.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-45" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9509022_xl-200x300.jpg" alt="Annapolis Kids Eyeglasses" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9509022_xl-200x300.jpg 200w, http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9509022_xl-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://annapolis.eyefitvisioncenters.com/eyeglasses/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9509022_xl-624x936.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Annapolis Kids Eyeglasses</p></div>
<p>It is generally recommended that children begin seeing an eye doctor about once a year from the time that they are about six months old. Children’s eye exams are recommended for several reasons. For the most part, children are still growing and developing. An eye exam can help make sure that their eyes and their vision are developing normally as well, and if any issues are spotted they can be treated promptly. Early changes can be treated to help prevent lifelong vision impairments, but there are some eyesight issues that cannot be reversed or treated permanently. It is common for children to develop vision problems like nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism, and if these issues develop then your child will need to wear the proper eyewear in order to see clearly. Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, we can provide your kids with vision screenings that will test the quality of their vision and determine what their prescription needs are. From there, we can show you our selection of <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis kids eyeglasses</a>. We have a wide range of styles for your kids to choose from and we also have several options regarding the type of lenses that you can have installed in the frames you choose. It’s important that children’s eyeglasses fit properly, and our team of opticians will help you choose a pair of frames, select your styles and features, and make sure that they fit your child’s face comfortably.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important that kids be able to see clearly. Kids are visual learners so prescribing the proper lenses when they need them can help immensely, no matter how strong of a prescription they may need. If you are looking for a place to test your child’s vision needs and get children’s eyeglasses, call us here at EyeFit Vision Centers and see our selection of <a href="../../../../index.html">Annapolis kid’s eyeglasses</a>.</p>

<p>Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, our <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> are some of our most important services offered. They may seem simple, but that does not take away how crucial eye exams are to maintaining good eye health, and good health in general. Many people do not realize that your eyes are more than just the “windows to your soul,” as the saying goes, and that they too are the windows to the health of other areas of your body. Symptoms in your eyes and vision can be indicative of a wide range of health issues, including and excluding specifically eye and vision-related problems. In addition, it is important to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis due to the nature in which most eye problems develop: slowly. Many potentially serious eye conditions develop so gradually that it can be difficult to notice the subtle changes that occur in your vision or eye health as a result. The danger of this is that many people are unaware that they have a problem until the symptoms have built up and already done real damage. In order to avoid this, it is best to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis at a frequency recommended by the professionals here at EyeFit Vision Centers. When you choose to get your <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> with us, you can trust that you will get the fullest evaluation of your eye and vision health thanks to our expert eye care professionals, our state-of-the-art facility, and the reliable and informative testing methods that we use.
