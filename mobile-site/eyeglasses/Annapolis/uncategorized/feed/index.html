<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you wear sunglasses in the fall and winter months? If not, you should. Today doctors are talking about the importance of wearing sunscreen year round to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful rays. Many facial cosmetics even contain sunscreen to protect your face and lips throughout the year. It is just as important to wear sunglasses for UV protection for your eyes, even during the fall and winter month. If you want to get new <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">sunglasses in Annapolis</a>, you will be very excited to see our large selection at EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you come to our vision practice and optical boutique, our frame experts and opticians will be able to help you get the right kind of sunglasses that will provide UV protection. Our optometrist is Dr. Deborah Amoroso. There are different kinds of sunglasses lenses available, but not all provide this type of protection for the eyes. It is important to get sunglasses in Annapolis that block out 100% of the sun’s UVA and UVB rays in order for your eyes to be fully protected. Overexposure to these rays can cause many different eye problems down the road, including cataracts. When you are getting regular eyeglasses, there are also lens options that will eliminate UV exposure. Our optometrist, optician or frame expert will be able to give you additional information about these lens options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, you also want your <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">sunglasses in Annapolis</a> to be stylish and fashionable. For this reason we offer a wide selection of sunglasses for you to choose from. Our frame experts will be happy to help you find sunglasses that compliment your face shape and fashion sense. Sunglasses also have different colored lenses that may perform additional functions. Our knowledgeable experts will be happy to let you know more about the sunglasses you are thinking about purchasing, to make sure they are as functional as you would like for them to be. If you would like to get prescription sunglasses, you can make an appointment to see our optometrist for a new lens prescription. Patients enjoy the convenience of our one-stop-shopping optical center which allows them to get new eyeglass prescriptions, and then select great frames from the very same location. For an appointment with our optometrist contact us today. To only get a new eyeglass frame or pair of sunglasses, no appointment is ever necessary.</p>

<p>Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, our <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> are some of our most important services offered. They may seem simple, but that does not take away how crucial eye exams are to maintaining good eye health, and good health in general. Many people do not realize that your eyes are more than just the “windows to your soul,” as the saying goes, and that they too are the windows to the health of other areas of your body. Symptoms in your eyes and vision can be indicative of a wide range of health issues, including and excluding specifically eye and vision-related problems. In addition, it is important to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis due to the nature in which most eye problems develop: slowly. Many potentially serious eye conditions develop so gradually that it can be difficult to notice the subtle changes that occur in your vision or eye health as a result. The danger of this is that many people are unaware that they have a problem until the symptoms have built up and already done real damage. In order to avoid this, it is best to visit us for eye exams in Annapolis at a frequency recommended by the professionals here at EyeFit Vision Centers. When you choose to get your <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> with us, you can trust that you will get the fullest evaluation of your eye and vision health thanks to our expert eye care professionals, our state-of-the-art facility, and the reliable and informative testing methods that we use. We also offer a wide range of additional eye care services that we can recommend as they are needed.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about what our <a href="../../../../index.html">eye exams in Annapolis</a> entail, or if you are interested in reading up on any of the other various eye care services and products available to you here at EyeFit Vision centers, we highly recommend that you visit our practice’s main informative website, which contains a wealth of detailed information that could prove useful to you.
