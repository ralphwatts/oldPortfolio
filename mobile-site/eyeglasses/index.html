<p style="text-align: justify;">Comprehensive eye exams are essential in the diagnosis and treatment of your child’s vision problems, injuries, and diseases. Early detection allows for treatment to begin before the child experiences difficulty in school due to poor vision, or before any permanent damage has been done to the eye(s). At our <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, we strive to provide the highest quality of care so that your child can achieve optimal vision and eye health that does not affect their school work or other everyday activities. We focus on kid-friendly eye exams along with medical and surgical treatment for our littlest patients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eye examinations for children are especially important as five to ten percent of preschoolers and 25 percent of school-aged children have vision problems. The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends that infants have their first eye exam at six months of age. Children should be re-examined at age three, and again just before they enter the first grade. Scheduling your child’s eye exam is crucial as many basic skills required in a child’s learning are associated with good eyesight, such as near and distance vision, binocular (two eyes) coordination, peripheral awareness, and hand-eye coordination. The AOA suggests that children who do not require vision correction should receive an eye exam every two years. Otherwise, children who do wear corrective lenses should have their vision evaluated annually. Comprehensive exams also test visual acuity, eye tracking and focusing skills, as well as detect problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, amblyopia, crossed eyes, dyslexia, and color blindness. Our team of caring Annapolis optometrists will also check for eye disease during your child’s eye exam, as well as assess how their eyes work together, and evaluate their eyes as an indicator of their overall health. Our office offers state of the art diagnostic equipment, including retinal photography and visual field testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis optometry</a> office of EyeFit Vision Centers, our mission is to preserve, restore, and enhance the vision of every member of your family. We are particularly inclined to treat those littler patients, as establishing good eye health early can deter further complications with their eyes and overall optical health. Please call our office today if you have any questions regarding pediatric eye exams, or if you would like to schedule an appointment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are experiencing blurry vision, it is vital you visit your eye doctor to ensure your eyes are in good health, and that it is not an underlying symptom of a more serious condition. Although your blurry vision may be due to something as simple as general near- or far-sightedness, it could also be the early signs of glaucoma. A visit to your <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis eye doctor</a> at EyeFit Vision Centers for glaucoma screening and eye care will help determine and treat whatever the cause of your blurred vision may be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the United States, is an eye disease that can lead to a permanent loss of vision. Actually, glaucoma is not just one eye disease, but a group of eye conditions resulting in optic nerve damage, which causes loss of vision. Abnormally high pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure) usually, but not always, causes this damage. We provide all diagnostic and treatment options for glaucoma care, including glaucoma screening in. Glaucoma generally provides no warning signs or symptoms of disease, making testing an important part of a full vision exam. If it is determined that you do suffer from glaucoma, our Annapolis eye doctor will discuss which treatment plan is best for your individual needs. Glaucoma can be treated with eye drops, pills, laser surgery, traditional surgery, or a combination of these methods. The goal of any treatment is to prevent loss of vision, as vision loss from glaucoma is irreversible. Surgery can be an incredibly effective treatment option for your eye disease. Laser treatments, for example, can be utilized for precise treatment and quick healing. However, it is best to consult our doctors first to best decide on a treatment plan right for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Early diagnosis and treatment can minimize or prevent optic nerve damage and limit glaucoma-related vision loss. It&#8217;s important to get your eyes examined regularly, and make sure your eye doctor measures your intraocular pressure. So even if your vision is blurry, it is clear where you should go for your glaucoma testing and treatment; call EyeFit Vision Centers today to schedule an appointment with one of our <a href="http://eyefitvisioncenters.com">Annapolis eye doctor</a>.</p>

With <a href="../index.html">Annapolis kid’s eyeglasses</a>, your children will be able to see comfortably and clearly no matter what.</p>

<p>It is generally recommended that children begin seeing an eye doctor about once a year from the time that they are about six months old. Children’s eye exams are recommended for several reasons. For the most part, children are still growing and developing. An eye exam can help make sure that their eyes and their vision are developing normally as well, and if any issues are spotted they can be treated promptly. Early changes can be treated to help prevent lifelong vision impairments, but there are some eyesight issues that cannot be reversed or treated permanently. It is common for children to develop vision problems like nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism, and if these issues develop then your child will need to wear the proper eyewear in order to see clearly. Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, we can provide your kids with vision screenings that will test the quality of their vision and determine what their prescription needs are. From there, we can show you our selection of <a href="../index.html">Annapolis kids eyeglasses</a>. We have a wide range of styles for your kids to choose from and we also have several options regarding the type of lenses that you can have installed in the frames you choose. It’s important that children’s eyeglasses fit properly, and our team of opticians will help you choose a pair of frames, select your styles and features, and make sure that they fit your child’s face comfortably.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important that kids be able to see clearly. Kids are visual learners so prescribing the proper lenses when they need them can help immensely, no matter how strong of a prescription they may need. If you are looking for a place to test your child’s vision needs and get children’s eyeglasses, call us here at EyeFit Vision Centers and see our selection of <a href="../index.html">Annapolis kid’s eyeglasses</a>.</p>

<p>People of all ages need to have eye exams. Whether we are talking about a young child, adult, or senior, it is important that comprehensive eye exams are performed on a regular basis. While every age group has its own eye care challenges, our optometrist will be able to help each individual receive the eye care that they need. If you want to see an optometrist who can provide you and family members with comprehensive eye exams, you will do well to visit us at our <a href="../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>, EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>
<p>At our practice, you will be able to see an expert optometrist who will be able to give you a complete eye exam, or complete contact lens exam. If any diseases or disorders of the eye show up during the exam, our optometrist will either be able to treat the problem or refer you to an expert ophthalmologist for more involved medical care. Eye examinations are important at every age as there are serious eye problems that can develop at any point in your life. During a regular eye exam there will be a lot of testing done to uncover any possible eye problems. However, we want to assure you that you will be totally comfortable during the entire exam. There is no need for worry or concern when you get an eye exam at our <a href="../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a>.</p>
<p>During a comprehensive eye exam many tests are performed. Your eyes will be checked to see if there are any refraction problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism. Your eyes will be screened for a variety of problems including: glaucoma; cataracts; retinal problems; macular degeneration; or other problems of the eye. Regularly scheduled eye exams are so important because many eye problems do not have any obvious symptoms until vision has already been lost. For example, glaucoma has very few noticeable symptoms in the early stages. However, glaucoma can already be starting to gradually steal your sight. Once this disease is properly diagnosed it can be treated and most likely be kept at bay with continuous treatment. There is no need to lose any sight to this disease. However, if glaucoma is not diagnosed until a later stage, it is more difficult to treat. Also, any vision that has already been lost will not be able to be restored. Our <a href="../index.html">Annapolis vision center</a> wants everyone to be able to keep their precious vision, and for that reason we encourage all to have regularly scheduled eye exams. If you would like to make an appointment to meet with one of our fine optometrists, contact us today at EyeFit Vision Centers to make an appointment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are in need of a comprehensive eye exam, or a new prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses, you will want to visit EyeFit Vision Centers. There are 11 locations to choose from, and we offer fine optometric service at each of our locations. If you are in need of <a href="../index.html">Annapolis eyeglass lenses</a>, we offer not only eye exams by highly-qualified doctors, but also each location offers a wide selection of eyeglass frames to fit every budget and fashion need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that you have a comprehensive eye exam on a regularly-scheduled basis. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, have no obvious symptoms during their early stages. However if not detected early, eye diseases may cause irreversible vision loss. During a comprehensive eye exam, not only will we determine your visual acuity, but we will also screen you for many eye diseases and conditions that may be at the initial period of affecting your eyesight. The prescription you get at the conclusion of the exam will be the prescription that will work best for your new Annapolis eyeglass lenses. Not only will you be thrilled with your new eyeglass frames, should you choose to purchase a set, you will also be thrilled with your fresh, clearer vision that you will get to enjoy every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During a comprehensive eye exam, your eyes will be tested for diseases and conditions such as: glaucoma; diabetic retinopathy; macular degeneration; and cataracts. You may also have drops put in to dilate your eyes so that the back, retinal portion of your eye can be closely examined for any type of retinal problems. The corneal surface of your eye will also be examined for any types or corneal irregularities. If you need a contact lens prescription, you will have tests to measure the curvature of your cornea and the size of your iris. You may also be examined for dry eye. Once you have had your complete eye exam, you will be able to get new <a href="../index.html">Annapolis eyeglass lenses</a>, or contact lenses, knowing that you now have the best up-to-date prescription to fit your vision needs. So whenever you think of eye exams or eyeglass and contact lens prescriptions, we hope your will think of EyeFit Vision Centers.</p>

<p>Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, the number one <a href="../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a>, contact lenses are by far some of our most popular products. Contact lenses are so popular because they are so versatile and available in so many forms, so that they can cater to a wide range of patients’ needs and special interests. Here at EyeFit Vision Centers, we make sure that finding the contact lenses you need at our <a href="../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a> is as easy and convenient as it can be. The first step to getting contact lenses, whether it is your first time using them or you have used them for years, is to schedule a contact lens exam. Contact lens exams are crucial when it comes to making sure that your optical prescription for your lenses is accurate, as well as determining the proper measurements for your contact lenses so that they are fitted properly and they are comfortable for you to wear. Contact lens exams are similar to regular eye exams, they simply require a few extra steps related to your contact lenses and so may take a little while longer. It is important to come in to our <a href="../index.html">Annapolis optometry vision center</a> for a contact lens exam once a year so that we can check on your prescription and make changes as they are needed. If it is your first time using contact lenses, after your exam we will try different lenses with you and show you how to use them so that you end up with the perfect lenses for your needs, and so that you feel confident using them and taking care of them each day.</p>
